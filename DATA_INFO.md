Eurostat is the statistical office of the European Union with the mission to provide high-quality statistics and data on Europe.


	European Forest Accounts (EFA): 
	Eurostat's annual data collection on forest resources and economic activity in forestry and logging industry. The EFA questionnaire and its explanatory notes can be found on the methodological section of environmental statistics and accounts. In addition to data on forest area and the volume of timber, EFA also covers economic data on forestry and logging, output of the forestry industry by type, physical and monetary data on supply and use of wood, and employment data. These are explained in the metadata file for Economic aggregates of forestry.

	FAO - Forest Resources Assessment (FAO - FRA): 
	5 yearly data collection

	Forest Europe - State of Europe's Forests: 
	5 yearly data collection
